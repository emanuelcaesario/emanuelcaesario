## Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Emanuel Berkah Caesario, Aspiring Data Scientist and Student at Practicum Indonesia
I am taking a course to become a data scientist at Practicum Indonesia. I learned a number of data scientist skills, such as Python, SQL, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision. I'm also learning Excel, HTML & CSS Basics, VSCode, and Jupyter Notebook.

I'm currently working as an economics journalist and editor in one of the largest mass media groups in Indonesia.</p>
