## Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Emanuel Berkah Caesario, Student at Practicum Indonesia
I am an economic journalist and aspire to become a data scientist. I'm currently taking a data scientist course at Practicum Indonesia and learning a number of important skills, such as Python, SQL, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision. I'm also learning Excel, HTML & CSS Basics, VSCode, and Jupyter Notebook.
